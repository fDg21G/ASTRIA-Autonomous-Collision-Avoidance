# ASTRIA – AI-Driven Autonomous Collision Avoidance for LEO CubeSats

## Overview
ASTRIA is an independent aerospace research project focused on developing an
autonomous, AI-assisted collision risk assessment and avoidance system for
CubeSats operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

## Problem Statement
LEO is increasingly congested with active satellites and debris.
CubeSats often lack continuous ground-based monitoring, increasing collision risk.

## Solution
ASTRIA integrates:
- Real-time TLE ingestion
- SGP4 orbital propagation
- Multi-stage conjunction screening
- Machine learning-based risk classification
- Fuel-efficient maneuver planning

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SGP4
- NumPy / SciPy
- XGBoost
- Poliastro
- Monte Carlo simulations

## Project Status
Prototype / Research Stage
